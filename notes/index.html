        <h2>Miscellaneous notes</h2>
        These are notes I have written primarily for my own understanding.
        I'm posting them here in case they are useful to others.
        If you find any errors or have criticisms, please let me know (at the email above) so that I'm not spreading false information!

        Nothing here... for now!

                <a href="./solvable_dmft.pdf">Notes on an exactly solvable dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)</a> (May 2025).
                Here, I derive the DMFT for a simple linear model by directly analyzing the microscopic solution to the equations of motion and by using the cavity method.
                This is a useful pedagogical excercise for understanding where each term comes from in a single-particle DMFT equation of motion.
